# ðŸš€ DSA Problems Collection

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to various DSA problems that I solve while practicing for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- Each folder/file represents a specific problem.
- Problems are categorized based on **topics** (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.).
- Solutions are implemented in **Python** (and may expand to other languages later).

Example structure:
/Arrays
   â”œâ”€â”€ TwoSum.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ MaxSubarray.py
/Strings
   â”œâ”€â”€ PalindromeCheck.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ Anagram.py
/LinkedList
   â”œâ”€â”€ ReverseLinkedList.py

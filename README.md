# 🚀 DSA Problems Collection

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to various DSA problems that I solve while practicing for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder/file represents a specific problem.
- Problems are categorized based on **topics** (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.).
- Solutions are implemented in **Python** (and may expand to other languages later).
